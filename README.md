# websocket-test
A simple example of how to use WebSockets with BrightSign

This application runs a node.js server on the BrightSign, and uses the free service at www.websocket.org. The code in index.html is copied directly from https://www.websocket.org/echo.html.

To run it, put the files on and SD card, connect the BrightSign player to the internet, and power it up. You should see "RESPONSE: WebSocket rocks" on the connected display.
